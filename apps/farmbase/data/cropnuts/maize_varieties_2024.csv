H6213,Kenya Seed,NCLB; Gray Leaf Spot; Rust,>2000m,,High; similar to H6218,Highland variety; uneven emergence challenges
H6218,Kenya Seed,NCLB; Gray Leaf Spot; Rust,>2000m,,Slightly higher yielding than H6213,Better standing power than H6213
H6506,Kenya Seed,MLND,>2000m,,Poor performance except off-season,Variable plant height; not combine-harvest friendly
Tembo 73,Seedco,Gray Leaf Spot susceptibility,>2000m,,Good,Very tall; more uniform than similar varieties
Pannar 691,Pannar,Bacterial Rots; low NCLB,>2000m,,Top third in trials,Grain quality sometimes variable
P3812W,Pannar,Rust; Stalk Rot,>2000m,,Higher yields than Pannar 691,Responsive to higher populations
9M-91,,MLND,>2000m,,Promising yields; leafy and high biomass,"New variety, too early to confirm performance"
